# send-email-function
This Firebase Cloud Function sends an email feeback to any user that visits my portfolio site and decides to contact me. Thereafter, an email is sent to me to notify me that someone wants to 'Get in Touch' or 'Hire Me'. In addition, using the Admin SDK, Firebase Cloud Messaging is instructed to send the client mobile app a notification. I am still working on the mobile app

# Generate your SendGrid API key
If you intend using this Cloud Function in any of your projects and want to take advantage of the email sending functionality, you will need to create an account on SendGrid and generate your API key

# Usage
I wrote this function so that users who visit my portfolio site get an email whenever they send me a message in the 'get in touch' or 'hire me' section of my portfolio. Check out my portfolio https://engels-immanuel.web.app

PS: I wrote my portfolio site and the mobile app (still in development) with Flutter ðŸ˜‰

Feel free to modify and/or use this Firebase Cloud Function in any of your projects. PR's are also welcomed ðŸ™ƒ
